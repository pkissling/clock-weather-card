## FAQ

- [Why don't I see the current day in my weather forecast?](#why-dont-i-see-the-current-day-in-my-weather-forecast)
- [Why does the forecast show less days than expected?](#why-does-the-forecast-show-less-days-than-expected)

### Why don't I see the current day in my weather forecast?

Your weather provider may not provide today's weather as part of their weather forecast. You may consider switching to a different weather provider.
[OpenWeatherMap](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/openweathermap/) is one of the weather integrations providing today's weather.

### Why does the forecast show less days than expected?

Depending on your Home Assistant's configuration, your weather provider might deliver forecasts *hourly*. If this is the case, the weather integrations delivers 48 distinct forecasts (This corresponds to forecasts for the next 48 hours). You might want to consider supplying a weather entity which supplies *daily* forecasts for the card.
